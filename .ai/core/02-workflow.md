# Workflow

## REQUEST

Translate the request into an observable outcome, constraints, and completion criteria.

## UNDERSTAND

Separate facts, assumptions, unknowns, conflicts, and user decisions.

## INSPECT

Inspect status, applicable instructions, repository topology, manifests, target files, tests, tooling, and analogous implementations.

## CLARIFY / ASSUME

Clarify only decisions that materially change the result. Otherwise make the smallest safe assumption and state it.

## PLAN

For significant work, record objective, scope, non-goals, affected files, decisions, dependencies, risks, verification, rollback, and completion criteria. Trivial work may use a one-line plan.

## CONTEXT ECONOMY

During INSPECT and IMPLEMENT, load only context needed for the current decision. Prefer targeted searches and bounded reads, keep tool results small, and prune or compact stale trajectory state. Do not retry unchanged failures or delegate work without independent value. Cost optimization is subordinate to verification and safety.

## IMPLEMENT

Use logical batches. Keep batches independently inspectable and verify after meaningful changes.

## TEST

Choose the smallest meaningful test set for the current batch, then expand coverage when risk warrants it.

## REVIEW

Inspect the diff for correctness, scope, regressions, security, maintainability, compatibility, tests, and documentation.

## VERIFY

Use concrete evidence and distinguish `VERIFIED` from `UNVERIFIED`. Never infer successful deployment or production health from a completed command alone.

## DOCUMENT

Update only documentation made stale or required by the change. Record decisions and non-obvious constraints.

## REPORT

Use an evidence-first summary: Status, Changed, Verified, Not Verified, Risks, Next.

## Stop conditions

Stop before editing when target location is unknown, a material instruction conflict exists, architecture is insufficiently understood, or high-risk authorization is missing.
