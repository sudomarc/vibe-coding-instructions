- Prompt caching: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching/overview

Implementation implications:

- large toolsets can create substantial tool-definition context overhead;
- tool search can reduce upfront tool definitions;
- programmatic calls can keep intermediate results out of model context;
- prompt caching can lower the price of repeated context;
- context editing/compaction should be treated as a controlled information-loss operation.
