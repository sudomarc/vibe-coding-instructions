# Security Skill

Threat-model the changed surface. Identify trust boundaries, attacker-controlled input, privilege transitions, secret handling, sensitive data, logging exposure, injection vectors, and failure modes. Prefer established platform security mechanisms over custom cryptography or ad hoc authorization.

Do not claim a system is secure from a narrow test. Report the tested threat surface and residual risk.
