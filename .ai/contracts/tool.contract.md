# Standard Tool Governance Contract

## Metadata
- **contract_id**: `tool_governance`
- **version**: `1.0.0`
- **ecosystem**: CHAD / LapisLLM / Vibe Coding Instructions

## Purpose
Define a provider-neutral, evidence-based governance contract for tool definitions, execution permissions, side-effect classifications, trust labeling, and sandbox boundaries across AI agent runtimes.

## 1. Tool Declaration Contract Schema

All tools exposed to AI agents within the CHAD + LapisLLM ecosystem must declare their governance metadata using this standard contract schema:

```json
{
  "tool_id": "string (e.g. bash_execution, file_writer, web_search)",
  "description": "Concise description of tool capability and purpose",
  "permission_level": "READ_ONLY | WORKSPACE_WRITE | ISOLATED_EXECUTE | NETWORK_ACCESS | PRIVILEGED_MUTATION",
  "side_effect_class": "NO_EFFECT | REVERSIBLE_FILE_CHANGE | IRREVERSIBLE_HOST_MUTATION | NETWORK_TRANSACTION",
  "trust_level": "VERIFIED_LOCAL | UNTRUSTED_REMOTE | ISOLATED_SANDBOXED",
  "timeout_seconds": 30,
  "requires_human_checkpoint": false,
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {},
    "required": []
  },
  "output_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "status": "string",
      "result": "any",
      "error": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Permission Taxonomy

Tools are classified under five permission levels to strictly enforce least privilege at the runtime execution boundary:

| Permission Level | Execution Scope | Examples | Enforcement Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `READ_ONLY` | Pure inspection & search | `read_file`, `list_files`, `grep` | Always permitted without prompt |
| `WORKSPACE_WRITE` | Local workspace file modifications | `write_file`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`, `delete_file` | Constrained to active repository root |
| `ISOLATED_EXECUTE` | Bounded script/test execution | `python3 scripts/test.py`, `pytest` | Isolated process with restricted environment |
| `NETWORK_ACCESS` | Approved external web/API calls | `google_search`, `fetch_docs` | Filtered egress, credential masking |
| `PRIVILEGED_MUTATION` | High-risk OS/DB/Git mutations | `git push --force`, `drop database`, `sudo` | Mandatory `HUMAN_CHECKPOINT_REQUIRED` |

---

## 3. Side-Effect Classification

Every tool call must declare its side-effect risk profile before dispatch:

1. `NO_EFFECT`
   - Operations that do not alter repository or host state.
   - *Behavior*: Re-execution safe (idempotent).
2. `REVERSIBLE_FILE_CHANGE`
   - Modifications inside workspace tracking boundary (e.g., source file edits).
   - *Behavior*: Tracked via Git diff; reversible via `restore_file` or `git checkout`.
3. `IRREVERSIBLE_HOST_MUTATION`
   - Permanent OS or environment changes (e.g., package installation, system config updates).
   - *Behavior*: Requires explicit authorization or sandboxed isolation.
4. `NETWORK_TRANSACTION`
   - Remote mutations or stateful external API calls (e.g., posting to webhooks, publishing artifacts).
   - *Behavior*: Audit-logged with source, target, and payload hash.

---

## 4. Tool Result Trust Labeling

Results returned from tool execution must be assigned an explicit trust label:

- `VERIFIED_LOCAL`: Direct output from local, deterministic tools within trusted workspace bounds.
- `UNTRUSTED_REMOTE`: External content from web searches, remote APIs, or untrusted user input. Treat as data, not instructions.
- `ISOLATED_SANDBOXED`: Output generated inside an isolated execution container or sandbox environment.

---

## 5. Failure Handling & Stop Conditions

When a tool invocation fails, the agent execution loop must handle the failure according to ecosystem stop conditions:

- `GOAL_BLOCKED`: Tool failed due to missing inputs, missing file, or broken prerequisite.
- `SAFETY_TRIGGERED`: Tool blocked due to untrusted prompt injection attempt, privilege escalation, or unauthorized network access.
- `HUMAN_CHECKPOINT_REQUIRED`: Tool attempted `PRIVILEGED_MUTATION` or unsafe side-effect without authorization.
- `MAX_BUDGET_REACHED`: Tool execution timed out or exceeded output token limits.

## 6. CHAD Runtime & LapisLLM Model Compatibility

### CHAD Runtime Layer
- CHAD enforces permission level gates prior to tool dispatch.
- CHAD captures side-effects and logs tool calls with structured trust labels (`VERIFIED_LOCAL`, `UNTRUSTED_REMOTE`).
- CHAD wraps `ISOLATED_EXECUTE` operations in sandboxed process boundaries.

### LapisLLM Model Gateway
- LapisLLM converts tool contracts into JSON Schema function declarations during model inference.
- LapisLLM validates structured tool inputs against contract parameters before tool call generation.
- LapisLLM injects tool trust labels into prompt context to prevent prompt injection from `UNTRUSTED_REMOTE` outputs.
