# Claude Code Compatibility

Anthropic's public Claude Code material documents modular skills built around `SKILL.md` files with YAML metadata, explicit triggers, and optional bundled references, examples, scripts, and assets. This repository follows that shape while keeping its instructions original.

Anthropic's public tooling also demonstrates specialized agent roles for review and other tasks. This repository uses the same architectural idea through task-specific skills and optional orchestration guidance.

Claude Code-specific behavior can change between releases. For current behavior, consult the official Anthropic documentation or repository before relying on remembered details.

## Claude Code + Anthropic API

Use `docs/claude-code-anthropic.md` as the provider-specific profile when Claude Code connects directly to Anthropic. Claude Code automatically uses prompt caching; the default for API-key billing is a 5-minute cache TTL. Keep the model/effort stable during substantial tasks to preserve cache reuse.
